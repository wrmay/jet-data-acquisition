# Next #
- move gemfire-toolkit into ops-suite, have it built from source on each node
  (is this a good idea ? it requires each node to access a maven repo)
- public IP addresses
- get gfsh from outside working
- ability to specify a schedule for the cluster
- basic monitoring and alerting (monit for v1 ?)
- automatic creation of key for each environment
- initial pdx config preferences
- pull commonalities between aws_provision and aws_provision_storage into common file
- automatic backups to S3 (how will the S3 credentials be handled ?)

# Later #
- configurator gui
- WAN gateway
- Elastic Load Balancing
- cost estimate
