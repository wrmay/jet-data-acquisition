### Thinking

Next step is to install on pi and test.

- Should I move the generator off of the pi ?  Probably yes.  You can just use your laptop to hit it by IP.
- How to install and run on the pi
  - execution options
    - scripts
  - gradle ?



# Features

- expose Jet metrics via Prometheus
- send outputs to Prometheus so they can be visualized
- output visualization
- architecture diagram
- add some alerts
- MQTT source

# Possible optimizations
- look for a better implementation of RMS that doesn't involve constructing so many temporary objects
- Implement a Stream Serializer
