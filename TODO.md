# Now
- pull work so far into docker-compose
  - use the maven + alpine docker image
  - jet instance
  - generator
  - mc
  - jetmc ?


# Later
- make the audio parameters variable
- check into the standalone jet mc (still exists ?)
- fix the the problem with the jet jobs pane of mc
- add source to the key and introduce multiple sources
- update the data generator to write timestamped audio files
- look for a better implementation of RMS that doesn't involve constructing so many temporary objects

# Much Later
- maven based containers should not be using root user
