# To Do For Cloud / GreenGrass IoT Setup

- Device
    - make a Job that starts Jet 
    - make a Job that starts the GRPC SErvice
    - Make a job that deploys the job
    - Modify the job to send to use the Streaming Facility 
    - Make an (Greengrass) MQTT to Hz Relay (this approach makes MQTT replayable)
    - Make a Job that deploys the MQTT relay 

- Signal Source
    - deploy on cloud, possibly as a Core Device si it can make use of GreenGrass MQTT (?)
    - modify to send to MQTT

- Prometheus and Grafana 
  - Replace both of these with SiteWise
